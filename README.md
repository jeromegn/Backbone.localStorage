# Backbone localStorage Adapter v1.1.5

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage)

Quite simply a localStorage adapter for Backbone. It's a drop-in replacement for Backbone.Sync() to handle saving to a localStorage database.

## Usage

Include Backbone.localStorage after having included Backbone.js:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.localStorage.js"></script>
```

Create your collections like so:

```javascript
window.SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  
  localStorage: new Backbone.LocalStorage("SomeCollection"), // Unique name within your app.
  
  // ... everything else is normal.
  
});
```
### RequireJS

Include [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org):

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="lib/require.js"></script>
```

RequireJS config: 
```javascript
require.config({
    paths: {
        jquery: "lib/jquery",
        underscore: "lib/underscore",
        backbone: "lib/backbone",
        localstorage: "lib/backbone.localStorage"
    }
});
```

Define your collection as a module:
```javascript
define("someCollection", ["localstorage"], function() {
    var SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
        localStorage: new Backbone.LocalStorage("SomeCollection") // Unique name within your app.
    });
  
    return new SomeCollection();
});
```

Require your collection:
```javascript
require(["someCollection"], function(someCollection) {
  // ready to use someCollection
});
```

### CommonJS

If you're using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).

```javascript
var Backbone.LocalStorage = require("backbone.localstorage");
```
