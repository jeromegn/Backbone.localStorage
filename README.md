# Backbone localStorage Adapter v1.0

Quite simply a localStorage adapter for Backbone. It's a drop-in replacement for Backbone.Sync() to handle saving to a localStorage database.

## Usage

Include Backbone.localStorage after having included Backbone.js:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.localStorage.js"></script>
```

Create your collections like so:

```javascript
window.SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  
  localStorage: new Backbone.LocalStorage("SomeCollection"), // Unique name within your app.
  
  // ... everything else is normal.
  
});
```
  
Feel free to use Backbone as you usually would, this is a drop-in replacement.
